This repository contains materials related to my paper on RNN seq2seq models learning non-regular transduction tasks. Source code, data, experimental results (including saved models), training logs, can also found in [this project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BO2LdbCFId3rY4BOX6Rcwn_m1WA8o912?usp=share_link) on Google Drive. 

Here is a brief description of the meaning of each sub-folders inside [the project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BO2LdbCFId3rY4BOX6Rcwn_m1WA8o912?usp=share_link) on Google Drive:

- ``data``: three versions of train/dev/test/generalization sets for reversed string and reduplicated string transduction tasks. Used for formal model training and evaluation. Results are reported. 
- ``tuning_data``: two sets of train/dev sets for the learning tasks. Used for manually searching for optimal hyperparameters. Results are not reported. 
- ``scripts``: code created for this project. 
- ``notebooks``: training and hyperparameter searching logs for eight experiments.
- ``Experiments_Logs``: experimental results of training and testing models on ``data``.



``notebooks`` and ``scripts`` are placed in this report for temporary viewing. To be updated.
